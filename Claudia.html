  <h1 style="color:yellow;">About Me</h1>
  <p style="font-family:ariel;"> Hello, I am Claudia Valencia. I am 16 years old and I going to be a Junior at Cristo Rey San Jose this upcoming school year. I enjoy trying out new things and I am always looking for an adventure. I have five members in my family: my twin, my nine-year-old sister, and my parents. My favorite foods are tacos and pupusas. My favorite colors are yellow, black, pink and purple. I don't necessarily have a pet,but I do own like 15 chickens. I wished that I wouldn't sacrafice my pet for dinner, but oh well. :( </p>
  
  <h1 style="color:yellow;">Hobbies</h1>
  <p style="font-family:ariel;"> My hobbies include: baking, cooking, running, reading, watching Netflix, going to record stores to find new music, hiking, and sleeping. I love listening to The Growlers, Lana Del Rey, Coldplay, Lorde, Mana, Enrique Iglesias, and Beyonce!  </p>
