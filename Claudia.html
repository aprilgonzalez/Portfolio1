  <p style="font-family:ariel;"> Hello, I am Claudia. I was born in December 16, 2000 and I am 16 years old. I love going to downtown San Jose and Campbell to try out new things or just to look whats new . I'm going to be a Junior at Cristo Rey San Jose this upcoming school year. I enjoy trying out new things and I am always looking for an adventure. I love hiking and going to new places. I have five members in my family: my twin, my nine-year-old sister, and my parents. My favorite foods are tacos, enchiladas, tortas and pupusas. My favorite colors are yellow, black, pink and purple. I don't necessarily have a pet, but I do own like 15 chickens. I wished that I wouldn't sacrafice my pet for dinner, but oh well.  :( </p>
  
   <h1 style="color:yellow;">Today 6/21* </h1>
    <p style="font-family:ariel;">The similarities between python and scratch is that both use similar functions like variables, conditionals, loop, Boolean, and conditionals. They are both very alike. Some differences are that Python uses data types and things like that.. I really liked how today we used how to use adobe Photoshop- very fun to learn. Today. My partner April and I worked on Atom and it was so much fun. It was a bit of challenge because you couldn't make a single mistake or the program wouldn't let you run the code. It was fun figuring out ways to make shapes with colors.I feel proud of our program, it came out looking pretty cool. 
   <h1 style="color:yellow;">Today 6/26* </h1>
  <p style="font-family:ariel;"> Today we learned about robots and the great impact it has. They can be very useful and they are pretty cool. Robots are cool and I am very excited to learn more about robotics and the great things we can make. I really liked how we worked on groups on the circuit board project. It was it bit of a challenge but it was fun. </p>
  
   <h1 style="color:yellow;">Hobbies</h1>
  <p style="font-family:ariel;">  My hobbies include: baking, cooking, running, reading, watching Netflix, going to record stores to find new music, hiking, and sleeping. I love listening to The Growlers, Lana Del Rey, Coldplay, Nirvana, Logic, Lady Gaga, Big Sean, Twenty One Pilots, Imagine Dragons, Lorde, Mana, Enrique Iglesias, Chris Price, Sia, Rihanna, Maroon 5, Kanye West, Katy Perry and Beyonce! </p>
